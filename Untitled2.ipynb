    "In this assignment, I will explore, segment, and cluster the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto based on the postalcode and borough information.. However, unlike New York, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. What is interesting about the field of data science is that each project can be challenging in its unique way, so i need to learn to be agile and refine the skill to learn new libraries and tools quickly depending on the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto. I will scrape the Wikipedia page [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_M) and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas  dataframe so that it is in a structured format like the New York dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataframe will consist of three columns: PostalCode, Borough, and Neighborhood\n",
    "Only process the cells that have an assigned borough. Ignore cells with a borough that is Not assigned.\n",
    "More than one neighborhood can exist in one postal code area. For example, in the table on the Wikipedia page,  notice that M5A is listed twice and has two neighborhoods: Harbourfront and Regent Park. These two rows will be combined into one row with the neighborhoods separated with a comma as shown in row 11  in the above table.\n",
    "If a cell has a borough but a Not assigned  neighborhood, then the neighborhood will be the same as the borough.\n",
